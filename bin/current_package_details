=head1 NAME

current_package_details - get the Rakudo details in the latest chocolately files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This program is a modulino. You can use it like a library in other
programs:

	require 'current_package_details';

	# get the most recent
	my %hash = get_package_details();

You can call it like a program, which outputs a JSON string:

	% perl5.24 current_package_details
	{"sha256":"6654495651890ebcee98c0d33d392cdcdc18d8deb0412f6f7026cb730bf0bbed",
	"url":"http:\/\/rakudo.org\/downloads\/star\/rakudo-star-2017.04.1-x86_64%20(JIT).msi",
	"version":1}

Consider piping that JSON string to another program that might do more
in the process (such as modifying templates).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can use this as a program or a library. This is specialized for
use with the chocolately package for Rakudo Star, a distribution of
Perl 6. In most uses, you probably want the default values for all
parameters.

sub run {
	state $rc = require Mojo::JSON;
	print Mojo::JSON::encode_json( get_package_details() );
	}

=item * get_package_details( URL, FILENAME, UNLINK )

Extracts the distribution details from the current chocolatey files.

	my %hash = (
		url     => $latest_rakudo_url,
		version => $version,
		sha256  => $sha256,
		);

=cut

sub get_package_details () {
	my $latest_rakudo_url = get_latest_url();
	my $version           = extract_version();
	my $sha256            = get_sha256();

	my %hash = (
		url     => $latest_rakudo_url,
		version => $version,
		sha256  => $sha256,
		);

	return \%hash
	}

=item * get_latest_url( FILE )

Get the URL for the latest Rakudo distribution listed in FILE. This does
simple text matching against the PowerShell files in this distribution. If
those formats change, this probably needs to change.

The default FILE is F<tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1>.

=cut

sub get_latest_url ( $file = 'tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1' ) {
	_find_pattern( $file, qr{\$url64\s+=\s+'(.*?)'} )
	}

=item * get_sha256( FILE )

Extracts the SHA256 from FILE. This does simple text matching against
the PowerShell files in this distribution. If those formats change,
this probably needs to change.

The default FILE is F<tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1>.

=cut

sub get_sha256 ( $file = 'tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1' ) {
	_find_pattern( $file, qr{checksum64\s+=\s+'(.*?)'} )
	}

=item * extract_version( FILE )

Extract the Rakudo Star version from FILE. This does simple text
matching against the NuSpec file in this distribution. If the format
changes, this probably needs to change.

The default FILE is F<rakudostar.nuspec>.

=cut

sub extract_version ( $file = 'rakudostar.nuspec' ) {
	_find_pattern( $file, qr{<version>(.*?)</version>} )
	}

sub _find_pattern ( $file, $regex ) {
	open my $fh, '<:utf8', $file;
	while( <$fh> ) {
		next unless $_ =~ $regex;
		return $1;
		}
	}
